# IPL_winningteam_prediction
üöÄ Developed a machine learning model to predict the winning team in IPL matches! 
üèè This project dive deep into IPL match data and use advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques to build a predictive model.analyzing datasets from `matches.csv` and `deliveries.csv`, handling missing values, updating team names, and filtering data for relevance. For feature engineering, I calculated essential match features and generated cumulative scores and wickets data for accurate match progression analysis. 

Using `scikit-learn`, I built a logistic regression model with a custom pipeline, employing one-hot encoding for categorical variables. The model achieved promising accuracy, and I used robust evaluation techniques to ensure its reliability. The technical stack for this project included Python, Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation, Scikit-learn for model building and evaluation, Matplotlib for data visualization, and Pickle for model serialization.

One of the most exciting parts of this project was integrating the model into a user-friendly Streamlit application. This app allows users to input match details and get real-time predictions on the probability of each team winning, providing an interactive and insightful tool for cricket enthusiasts and analysts.
The project workflow encompassed data loading, cleaning, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization for predicting IPL match outcomes. Visualization involved plotting match progression with run and wicket data for better interpretability.
