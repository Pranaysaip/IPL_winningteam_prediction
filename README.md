🚀 AI-Powered Breast Cancer Detection Project 🚀
I'm thrilled to share my latest project for my internship at InternPe, which harnesses the power of neural networks to enhance breast cancer detection using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

🔍 Key Features:
Data Handling: Implemented effective data scaling and preparation techniques.
Neural Network Architecture:
Input Layer: 64 neurons with ReLU activation to handle feature input.
Hidden Layer: 32 neurons with ReLU activation, balancing complexity and computational efficiency.
Output Layer: A single neuron with Sigmoid activation to produce a clear binary classification for cancer detection.
Performance: Achieved High accuracy.
Deployment: Saved the trained model and scaler for consistent future predictions.

🌟 Impact: This project underscores the potential of AI to revolutionize early breast cancer detection, paving the way for improved patient outcomes through timely and accurate diagnosis
